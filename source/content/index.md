Hello world!


"Member" of tpot tech Xwitter, with a dream to work at SpaceX. Or Apple. 

Any company that has a mission that's bigger than itself, with a fantastical - yet plausible - dream that they strive for in order to leave their mark for the betterment of mankind.

- I've studied Cybersecurity, IT, and InfoSys Quant Analysis stuff at a Big10 University. 
- I've worked in IT, from workstations to complex servers running critical services & operations.
- I've worked as a web developer, refactoring old PHP 5 code to PHP 7+, and putting it on the PHP framework, Laravel; plus vanilla JavaScript ES6, MySQL, and jQuery.
	- Also worked with REST APIs to make custom, map JavaScript apps to track cars for autonomous reserach.
- Stopped an active rootkit that was ongoing after being hired, as an undergrad.

Reading up on malware is one of my hobbies, besides irl stuff like playing/making music, art, & games.
