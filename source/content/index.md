Hello world!

THAT (tech) Part of Twitter,

with a dream to work at SpaceX. Or Apple. With freedom.

I like and am in cybersecurity + systems engineering but lately I've had my nose in ML/GAI since there's a high chance that's the only thing we'll be working with in 5 years. 

I think to think that I could make it to any company that has a mission that's bigger than itself, with a fantastical - yet plausible - dream that they strive for in order to leave their mark for the betterment of mankind. That is my goal, and that's the kind of company I want to build myself.

- Bachelor of Science in Multidisciplinary Studies: Cybersecurity, IT, & IS Quantitative Analysis 
- 5 years part-time & internship-level IT xp
- 2 years full time Systems engineer
- I've worked as a web developer, refactoring old PHP 5 code to PHP 7+, and putting it on the PHP framework, Laravel; plus vanilla JavaScript ES6, MySQL, and jQuery.
	- Also worked with REST APIs to make custom, map JavaScript apps to track cars for autonomous reserach.
- I've worked on many frameworks, dipping my toes in a lot of stacks.
- I've worked on almost all kinds of server OS architecture and planned infrastructure at a semi-mid level scale; haven't had the chance to work on anything massive yet.
- Stopped an active rootkit that was ongoing after being hired, as an undergrad.

Reading up on malware is one of my hobbies, besides irl stuff like playing/making music, art, & games.
