## **Understanding of Security Principles**

### **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad):** 

Emphasize how you maintain the confidentiality of sensitive data, ensure its integrity, and guarantee system availability.

### **Least Privilege:** 

Describe how you implement role-based access controls and reduce attack surfaces by restricting user permissions to only those necessary.

### **Defense-in-Depth:** 
Illustrate how you layer multiple security controls (firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint security) to create comprehensive defense mechanisms.

### **Zero Trust:** 
Discuss how you adopt a "never trust, always verify" model by using strict identity verification and continuous monitoring.
