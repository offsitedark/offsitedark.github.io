# Context: 

So there was a tweet the other day...

And apparently it's hard - off the rip I can't code this, but I got the answer "right" at first from the top of my head, but for some reason due to how the tweet and replies were phrased I had thought that the given output was incorrect, so I made up an alternate answer: 

```
1
12
13
124
135
136
```

So I figured it's time for a refresher as I'm not the best leet-coder - and I could honestly give less of a fuck for caring about this - but I thought it'd make good dev content purely because of this quoted tweet:

This posed as an interesting challenge, as I've no idea how'd you do it in any of those 3. It'd be good experience and something I can brag/advertise on my resume.


# Challenge: Do it in Go, Kubernetes, & SQLite
